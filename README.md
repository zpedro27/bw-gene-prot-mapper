# Info
Dashboard to visualize the location of genes in the chromosome of *E. coli* BW25113 and the corresponding protein abundances across multiple growth conditions (as reported by Schmidt et al. 2016).

Displays the gene-to-gene distances as well as the correlation between condition-dependent protein abundances.

To facilitate interpretation of the data, UniProt entries of the relevant proteins are shown.
